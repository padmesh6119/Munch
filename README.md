# 🧩 MUNCH

MUNCH is a command-line tool for basic encoding, decoding, and hashing. It's lightweight, animated, and just a bit cheeky. Think of it as a digital Swiss Army knife for text transformations.

## 🛠 What MUNCH Can Do

MUNCH offers 5 main functionalities:

1. **Encode** — Base64, Base32, Hex, Atbash, and ROT variations.
2. **Decode** — The reverse of the above.
3. **Generate Hashes** — Using popular algorithms like MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512.
4. **Identify Hash** — Guess the hash type based on its length.
5. **Exit** — Gracefully quit the program.

## 📦 Ciphers and Hashing Explained

### 🔤 Atbash Cipher
A classic monoalphabetic cipher where `A ↔ Z`, `B ↔ Y`, etc. Works the same for lowercase.

### 🔁 ROT Cipher
ROT-N rotates letters by `N` positions. For example, ROT13 turns `A` into `N`, `B` into `O`, and so on. MUNCH shows all 25 possibilities for maximum flexibility.

### 🧬 Base64 / Base32 / Hex
- **Base64**: Commonly used in data transmission (email, web).
- **Base32**: Less compact but better for case-insensitive environments.
- **Hex**: Encodes binary data in hexadecimal (0-9, a-f).

### 🔐 Hashing
Hashes turn your text into fixed-length strings. MUNCH supports:
- `MD5` – Fast but not secure.
- `SHA1` – Better, but still broken.
- `SHA224`, `SHA256`, `SHA384`, `SHA512` – Stronger and widely used.

> ⚠️ Hashes are one-way. You can't decode them.

## 🧠 How the Code Works (In Plain English)

### 1. **Graceful Exit**
```python
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, outro)
